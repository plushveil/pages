<h3 class="mt-0">Introduction to Pages</h3>
<p>
  Pages is a static site generator that utilizes&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals" class="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-200 underline">Template Literals</a>&nbsp;to create HTML files.
  It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while still providing a powerful tool for creating websites.
  Pages is built on top of Node.js and uses its native templating capabilities to generate static HTML files.
  Perfect for creating small to medium-sized websites, blogs, and portfolio sites.

<h4>Development server</h4>
<p>
  A built-in development server and live reload feature allow you to preview your site as you work on it.
  <code class="text-nowrap">npx @plushveil/pages serve .</code> will start the development server for the current directory.
</p>




<h4>Placeholder Substitution</h4>
<p>
  Define a single <code>&lt;link rel="canonical" href="/\${languages}/index.html"&gt;</code> tag to generate multiple pages, which is useful for creating SEO-friendly pages in different contexts, such as multi-language or multi-region sites.
  Or use script tags to define variables during the build process.
</p>



<h4>Built in minification</h4>
<p>
  Out of the box Pages minifies your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, reducing the size of your website and improving load times.
</p>



<h4>Tailwind CSS support</h4>
<p>
  Pages comes with built-in support for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-200 underline">Tailwind CSS</a>, a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create custom designs without writing custom CSS.
</p>



<h4>GitHub Action</h4>
<p>
  A GitHub Action that allows you to automate the deployment process, making it possible to only commit your website files to your repository and have the Pages GitHub Action take care of the rest.
  No need to store a development environment in your repository.
